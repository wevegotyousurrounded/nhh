    <h1>A little more about me</h1>
    <p>When I’m not busy with classes or coding, I enjoy exploring different hobbies and finding fun, creative ways to spend my time. Lately, I’ve been trying out digital art, experimenting with crochet, and losing myself in books that pique my interest. I love balancing the structured problem-solving of programming with hobbies that let me relax and express creativity.</p>
    <p>I’m also into video games and DIY projects—sometimes they work out perfectly, and other times, well… it’s all about enjoying the process! I’m always on the lookout for something new to learn, a fun challenge to take on, or just finding my own way of doing things.</p>
